the human brain is unfortunately, [[the predictive brain]]. It has evolved to predict what's going to happen next rather than respond to stimuli. Sometimes it will have [[prediction error]]s. One major and lesser known sense that messes with our predictions is [[interoception]]. This is the sense of our own body and organs. There are many receptors that tell us the overall state of the body, which our brain processes unconsciously.

Our brain then uses this information to generate responses, which can often affect our [[mood]]. Being aware of our own physical state is its own type of [[metacognition]] and can help with our [[emotional literacy and granularity]].
