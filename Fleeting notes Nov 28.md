## Thinking with sensations
- John Coates considered a pioneer of the sensation
- Interoception is an important skill
	- The body often responds before the consicioussness does
	- Understanding these signals can help us perform more efficiently
	- Allows us to peek into what non-conscious information our body has discovered

1. Sit/lie down in a comfortable place
2. Feel the body as a whole with each breath
3. "sweep" each part of the body, starting with the toes
	1. Try to channel breathing into those toes so that it feels like the breathing is coming from those toes
- The purpose is to bring awareness to all feelings in the body
- Attach names/feelings with high granularity to encourage regulation
