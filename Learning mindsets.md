We separate learning mindsets into [[fixed mindsets]] and [[growth mindsets]] , which are themselves [[representational structures]] we use to analyze ourselves and prime ourselves for learning. they shape how we percieve the world.

For example, [[fixed mindsets]] can often imply failure as a bad thing, showing that an individual isn't smart or good enough, whereas [[growth mindsets]] embrace mistakes as part of how [[learning, like all growth, is uncomfortable]]. 

Utilizing [[growth mindsets]] when practicing and trying to achieve mastery has been proven to have greater benefits, as there is no priming ourselves into believing there is a limit to our achievements. This is another example of why [[metacognition]] is so important to ensuring our knowledge and growth will be excellent.
