This type of cognition provides context switching for [[Type 2 (slow, deliberate) cognition]] and [[Type 1 (fast, automatic) cognition]], and is a kind of [[metacognition]]. This allows the individual to consciously switch between the two types of cognition as well as differentiate between the two. Developing this form of cognition in conjuction with the other types is where the real gains are, as being aware of which type of cognition best suits the task at hand.
