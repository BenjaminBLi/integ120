[[the predictive brain]] uses [[cognitive heuristics]] in order to predict the [[affect]] of other people normally. Determining the [[mood]] of an individual is a very complicated process that is usually relegated to [[Type 1 (fast, automatic) cognition]], since things like body language are hard to understand using [[Type 2 (slow, deliberate) cognition]], due to the sheer volume of information, some of which can be imperceptible (like pheremones).
