The knowledge triangle is a model of information that differentiates between information types that can be categorized into two groups, [[personal knowledge]] and [[public knowledge and culture]]. 

The triangle describes how the three types of knowledge ([[declarative knowledge]], [[nondeclarative knowledge]], [[public knowledge and culture]]) connect with each other - that is, the types of knowledge can transform into one another.
