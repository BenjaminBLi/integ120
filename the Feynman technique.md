This technique is used to deepen your understanding of a topic by teaching "everything" you know to another individual. It uses [[elaboration]] to accomplish this, and often helps us with [[discovering and addressing weaknesses and gaps in knowledge]]. The specific process involves the following for steps:

1. Study
This is the process of first accumulating your own [[personal knowledge]] 
2. Teach
We then use [[elaboration]] by attempting to teach the topic to another individual
3. Fill the gaps
the process of teaching will often reveal flaws in our knowledge where we cannot appropriately explain the topic. We then fill these gaps in our [[personal knowledge]] through the use of things such as [[smart notes]]
4. Simplify
Once all the gaps are filled, we simplify our knoweldge down to it's "atomic" parts similar to how we go about [[collecting, creating, and curating smart notes]]
