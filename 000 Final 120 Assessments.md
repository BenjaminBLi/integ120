# The Art & Science of Learning

As announced on Learn and discussed in class, we have to change how things are done for the final four weeks of the class given constraints imposed by my broken hand. :( 

This file contains everything you need to complete the remaining assessments in this course, **all of which are due by end of day on December 5th** (although you are free to submit your work, anytime between now and then). It assumes that you are doing the assigned readings, which have replaced the remaining lectures. As a reminder, [you can find the readings here](https://www.dropbox.com/home/THE%20EXTENDED%20MIND) until you are able to purchase your own copy. I expect you to read *The Extended Mind* by the end of the term, ideally on the following schedule:

- [x] Week 9: **Introduction** and **Chapter 1** 
- [ ] Week 10: Read *The Extended Mind*, **Chapters 2-3**
	- [x] Class 18 (M | Nov. 14): Emergency Course Changes, Q&A
	- [x] Class 19 (W | Nov. 16): In-class discussions, Feynman technique, and work on the tests and final connected concept submission. Feel free to participate remotely if you wish.  
- [ ] Week 11: Read *The Extended Mind*, **Chapters 4-6**
	- [x] Class 20 (M | Nov. 21): In-class discussions, Feynman technique, and work on the tests and final connected concept submission. Feel free to participate remotely if you wish.  
	- [x] Class 21 (W | Nov. 23): In-class discussions, Feynman technique, and work on the tests and final connected concept submission. Feel free to participate remotely if you wish.  
- [ ] Week 12: Read *The Extended Mind*, **Chapters 7-9**
	- [ ] Class 22 (M | Nov. 28): In-class discussions, Feynman technique, and work on the tests and final connected concept submission. Feel free to participate remotely if you wish.  
	- [ ] Class 23 (W | Nov. 30): In-class discussions, Feynman technique, and work on the tests and final connected concept submission. Feel free to participate remotely if you wish.  
- [ ] Week 13: Read *The Extended Mind*, **Conclusion**
	- [ ] Class 24 (M | Dec. 05): **FINAL DATE TO SUBMIT YOUR TESTS AND FINAL CONNECTED CONCEPTS ASSIGNMENT.** You may finalize your tests and assignment in class if you like.  

## The 3 Remaining Assessments 

**[[120 000#TESTS 2 & 3|TESTS 2 & 3]]** are combined below. There are a total of six long-answer questions. Each is worth a set number of points, and the points for all questions sum to 40. In other words, **each point translates to 1% of your final course grade.** There is no minimum or maximum word count for any particular question or for the tests overall. I do not care how much you right as long as you answer the questions well and provide plenty of evidence for what you say. In other words, I want you to "show" me instead of just "telling" me. There are many ways you can do this well and many ways you could do this poorly. In recognition of that reality, there is no rubric. However, for all components of the three remaining assessments, I have provided you the opportunity to submit your own self assessments. I will take them very seriously when determining your final grade.

The [[120 000#CONNECTED CONCEPTS 3|CONNECTED CONCEPTS 3]] submission is also included in this file. As before, you must submit a zip of your entire Obsidian vault to the Learn Dropbox. However, you will also have to write up an explanation of what you have done for the third submission in the relevant part of this file. Think of this as a formal "show and tell" or a written "guided tour" of your extended mind / second brain / whatever you want to call it. 

# TESTS 2 & 3 
40% of your final grade (20% + 20%)

> [!question] Question 1 (Weight: 10/40 Points)

> [!question] Question 6 (Weight: 6/40 Points)
> How has your understanding of the art and science of learning changed over the course of this semester? Regardless of your current learning abilities and metacognitive skills, what areas could you improve upon? How could you improve upon them, and what would you expect in return? What, if anything, do you feel you could have done differently to get more out of in this course? (No, you won't lose grades for an honest answer! You'll get points for self-awareness, honesty, and evidence of learning and growth.)

# CONNECTED CONCEPTS 3
20% of your final grade

> [!info] Show Off Your Second Brain (or Whatever...)
> "Personal knowledge management" (PKM) allows you to develop a powerful knowledge asset that will serve you your entire life, and it's value increases dramatically the more you use it. All PKM systems apply ideas from research on extended cognition to make (1) learning more effective and efficient; (2) your personal knowledge more accessible, discoverable, and (re)usable over the course of your lifetime; and (3) creative production of all kinds easier and less stressful. 
> 
> As discussed in class on Monday November 14th, "smart notes" are the foundation of many different PKM systems, but useful PKM systems can and should include other types of notes, files, and functionality (e.g., task management tools; journals; higher-order notes such as 'maps of content;' outliners and other writing tools; images and media files; standalone scripts, code snippets, and other programming utilities; etc.). Useful personal knowledge, management systems can also be organized in a variety of different ways, all of which have their strengths and limitations, and none of which are necessarily "the best" in all situations and for all people. In short, **effective personal knowledge management is personal!**  
> 
> In class on November 14, I asked you to spend a bit of time learning about different PKM systems and reflect on how they relate to your needs. I recommended looking into three approaches in particular: (1) Tiago Fortes' "Second Brain" system, (2) Zettelkasten, and (2) the LYT Toolkit. All three of these systems are popular and widely used, so you can easily find information about them online (including YouTube of course). I asked you to experiment a bit with ideas from these and any other PKM systems that interest you over the final four weeks of the semester.  
> 
> Below, please describe a few key ideas and practices from the broader world of PKM (Second Brain, Zettelkasten, PKM, etc.) that resonate with you, and which you have experimented with during these final four weeks. Then describe how your personal knowledge management system (implemented in your Obsidian Vault) works. Think of this as a kind of "show and tell" for your extended mind! Tell / show me about the thinking and design that went into your PKM system. Tell / show me about how you are using it, things you tried that didn't quite work for you or which you customized, and things that you would like to try in the future. Remember, your system will evolve and change over time. Whatever you come up with now is good for now, but you're not necessarily locked into it for the long term! You should let your system grow and evolve as you move through different stages of your life and as your needs and circumstances change .
