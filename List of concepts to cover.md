INTEG 120: The Art and Science of Learning  
is is a list of 100 concepts (!!!) that were introduced in the first 5 weeks of INTEG 120.  
Is that more or less than you expected?  
We have talked about things that are not on this list, but the first test will only focus on  
concepts from this list. ese are the concepts you want to ensure you understand. :)
