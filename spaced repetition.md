This is a learning system that is performed using things such as flashcards and is a form of [[self-testing]]. This type of reptition focuses on showing newer and more difficult information more frequently, and showing older and less difficult information less frequently to take advantage of the spacing effect. This helps with encoding knowledge into [[long term memory]] more efficiently.
