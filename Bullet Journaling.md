This is a journaling method we use to take [[smart notes]]. It's broken down into two major steps:
taking [[fleeting notes]], and [[connecting and combining smart notes]]. 

- Each page in a bullet journal is to be given a topic.
- An initial index helps you keep track of where topics are
- Tasks should be migrated as needed and on a monthly basis to ensure everything is sorted.

###Rapid logging
This is how the bullet journal got its name, and involves three types of bullets, and are a type of [[fleeting notes]]:
- Task bullets (indicated by a dot)
	- Mark it with an X when done
	- Mark with > if migrated to a collection and not done
	- mark with < if scheduled and then added to the future log
- Event bullet (indicated by an open circle)
- Note bullet (indicated by a dash) 
	- Notes that are wanted to remember

We also add a priority to each tasking using the [[prioritization matrix]].

### Migration
After rapid logging is complete, the tasks and other bullets should be migrated to their relevant collections, whether that be future logs, other collections, etc.
